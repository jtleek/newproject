## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
#edited by pramod-datascience@gmail.com
#install.packages("dplyr")  # used to install dplyr first as it was not available in my rstudio cloud, then it is commented 
library(dplyr)  # added to practice the jhu leanpub course.
glimpse(cars)   # added to practice the jhu leanub data science course.
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
